This data analysis project on the Zomato dataset has revealed several interesting insights into the restaurant landscape. Our investigation focused on three main areas: the relationship between price and popularity, the characteristics of popular cuisines, and the impact of table booking services. Here are our key findings:
Price vs. Popularity
Our analysis of the relationship between a restaurant's price (approximated by the cost for two people) and its popularity (measured by the number of votes) revealed in the .ipynb file.

This data analysis project on the Zomato dataset has revealed valuable insights into the restaurant landscape:

Price vs. Popularity: There's no strong linear correlation between a restaurant's price and its popularity. Highly-rated restaurants exist across various price points, with most clustering in the lower price range.
Popular Cuisines: Dining establishments dominate the market, followed by Cafes. This suggests a preference for sit-down meal experiences.
Table Booking Impact: Restaurants offering table booking services show significantly better performance metrics:

Higher average ratings (4.2 vs 3.6)
Higher average cost for two ($700 vs $400)
More votes (1000 vs 250 on average)
These differences are statistically significant, indicating that table booking could be a valuable service for restaurants to consider.


Top Restaurants: The most popular restaurants, led by Empire Restaurant and Meghana Foods, represent a mix of local establishments and chains, spanning various cuisines and price points.
Key Takeaways:

Higher-end restaurants with table booking services tend to perform better in terms of ratings and popularity.
While dining establishments are most common, there's significant diversity in cuisine types.
Factors beyond cost significantly influence a restaurant's popularity and ratings.


Future Research: To build on these findings, future analyses could explore:

The relationship between cuisine type and table booking availability
The impact of online ordering on restaurant popularity and ratings

This project provides valuable insights for restaurant owners, food service companies, and platforms like Zomato in understanding customer preferences and restaurant performance factors.
